Teams at the event form around the provided hack categories. If you would like to start a team or are looking for a team to join be sure to attend the opening ceremony, make an announcement, and talk to the people who are there. You can also propose or join a team through the event's forum, the event's Facebook page, or other relevant sites that other hackathon participants are likely to see.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Where do I find resources to work with?`}</h3>\n    <p>{`You can find developer resources in our `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"makerdao/awesome-makerdao/blob/master/README.md\"\n      }}>{`Awesome-MakerDAO`}</a>{` community repository.
