# Community Meetup Grants

A healthy and robust community plays an incredibly important role in building a long-lasting and strong ecosystem around MakerDAO. To support this goal, we are providing many types of resources. This Community Meetups Initiative gives community members all they need to host their own Maker oriented events.

Meetups are a useful resource for anyone interested in learning about Maker and becoming part of the MakerDAO community. Whether offering question-and-answer sessions, demos, presentations, or just time to network, meetups can spark a host of conversations, insights, and questions. They are the perfect tool for newcomers, people generally unfamiliar with the project, and for seasoned professionals who are interested in diving deeper into MakerDAO. Building up local communities and increasing Dai adoption will help bring stability and financial inclusion to everyone. To help community members launch meetups in their local communities we've included a micro-granting program that you can find more about [here](/meetups/meetup-diy-kit-en.md#Requesting-funds)

Please have a look at our [Meetup Kit](meetup-diy-kit-en.md) if you are interested in hosting an event in your community. The kit contains information about how to organize a successful event and how to apply for a MakerDAO microgrant.

If you have suggestions for how we can make the Meetup Kit better reach out to us in our chat in the [\#community-development](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development) channel.
