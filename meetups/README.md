### Community Meetups
We believe that community members, like you, are incredibly important to MakerDAO and play a valuable role in building a stronger ecosystem. The Community Development Group wants to provide the resources you need to increase Dai adoption and help us bring stability and financial inclusion to the underbanked. To do this, the we are making available a microgranting program dedicated to helping community members facilitate meetups in their communities.

Please have a look at our [Meetup Kit](./meetup-diy-kit.md) if you are interested in hosting an event in your community. The kit contains a wealth of information about how to organize a successful event and how to apply for a MakerDAO microgrant.
