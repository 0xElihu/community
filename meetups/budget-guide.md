# Budget Guide

This is a guide on how to manage the financial side of hosting a meetup. Before you get going, we want community members to have a specific mentality when it comes to costs; it's important to always aim to achieve the most value for the money you are spending. If you are being given an honorarium to cover expenses for this event, it will be based on the [Community Meetup Form](https://airtable.com/shr4HOtcZ8o3VZmek) you submit to us beforehand.

Here are some guidelines for how you should budget for your event.

## The Space

The type of event you are hosting will determine the requirements of the space. If possible, always try to use a free space or one that might be offered as part of a secondary sponsorship. An example of this would be your local university giving you a conference room for free, as a part of a deal you might have negotiated with them. There are various strategies for how to best go about securing a space.

However, if the type of event requires equipment or a specific location it may be worthwhile to pay a rental fee.

## The Equipment

The first thing to ask yourself is what kind of equipment do you need? Most meetups involve some type of presentation. If this is the case for your event, please make sure to find out if the space has the equipment available to facilitate this. I.e. a computer, projector, and screen. If the event is relatively small you can probably get through it without a microphone. Otherwise, it is usually always a good idea to have some form of voice amplification. If the venue has a microphone, they will likely have the speakers and system to use it with as well.

Ideally, you want to find a location that has all of these things included so you do not have to buy them yourself. If the venue does not have some of this equipment, the next possible step is to reach out to people attending your meetup. Posting in the event page, or reaching out to a few individuals you're familiar with might prompt someone to volunteer their own equipment to help out.

Beyond that, it is up to your own judgement to decide what you need to purchase. If you intend to do meetups at the same location in the future, then it might be a good idea to try to come to an agreement where the venue can hold on to any equipment you may have bought yourself. You can use this to negotiate cheaper rent prices, or simply to establish a good relationship with the venue.

## The Food and Beverages

Always check beforehand if the venue allows for food and drinks!

The cost of food and beverages depends on the number of people at the event, how long the event will go on for, and the types of food and beverages. Since this may vary widely between different meetups, the best advice to give here is for individuals to use their best judgement.

The longer a meetup, the more reasonable it is to provide light food and snacks. Coffee or tea is generally always a good idea.

## Banners and Printed Materials
