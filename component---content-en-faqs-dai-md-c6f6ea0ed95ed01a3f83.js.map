All circulating Dai are generated from `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"vault.md\"\n      }}>{`Maker Vaults`}</a>{` and are backed by a surplus of collateral assets.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Dai is used in the same manner as any other cryptocurrency: It can be freely sent to others, used as payments for goods and services, be held as a hedge against market volatility, and `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://awesome.makerdao.com/#use-dai\"\n      }}>{`much more`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Why would I want to use Dai?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Dai is a price-stable asset that can be used as money. It works well as a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account. A decentralized digital economy needs stable money in order to function. Dai solves this problem and enables a wide range of financial activities and applications that have previously been untenable due to the volatility of legacy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Additionally, the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"dsr.md\"\n      }}>{`Dai Savings Rate`}</a>{` enables Dai users to earn accruals on the Dai they save. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the things Dai can be used for:`}</p>\n    <p>{`Hedging: During periods of high market volatility, Dai offers a safe harbor to store value without having to exit the crypto ecosystem.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Exchange pairs: Crypto-to-crypto trading can be a complicated proposition. It is difficult to track earnings when both sides of a trading pair are rising and falling in value. Creating markets that pair with DAI creates lower risk markets for market makers, and gives regular traders a stable asset to trade against.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Financial products: Dai can be used as collateral for various types of financial instruments, and can also be accepted for repayment of debt.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Merchant receipts, cross-border transactions, and remittances: Dai transactions are borderless and settle in minutes compared to legacy cross-border transaction solutions, which often take days or weeks and charge high fees.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Prediction markets and gambling: Long term betting becomes infeasible if users also have to gamble on the future price of the asset they are wagering. A cryptocurrency with price stability like Dai can be the natural choice for prediction markets or gambling applications.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Retail and Consumer Use of Cryptocurrency: Use of cryptocurrency in regular day-to-day economic activity can only scale with a stable asset as a medium of exchange. Dai fills this role perfectly.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Is one Dai always worth exactly one USD?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`No, though it stays pretty close. Dai is not a hard-pegged currency, so it does not perfectly track the value of an existing fiat currency. Rather, it maintains a free-floating peg that experiences extremely low volatility against the US dollar. Notably, in the event of an `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"emergency-shutdown.md\"\n      }}>{`Emergency Shutdown`}</a>{`, each Dai is redeemable for $1 worth of collateral.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`How is the price of Dai kept stable?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Dai is not a hard-pegged currency, so it does not perfectly track the value of an existing fiat currency. Rather, it maintains a free-floating peg that experiences extremely low volatility against the US dollar.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It achieves this stability through a combination of external market forces, complementary internal economic incentives, and policy tools controlled by MKR token holders. Many different market actors behaving in their own self-interest, yet working in concert, contribute to its stability. These actors include MKR holders, arbitrageurs, Vault owners, Keepers, and market makers.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If Dai demand consistently exceeds Dai supply, or vice-versa, it creates a signal that MKR holders need to adjust the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"dsr.md\"\n      }}>{`Dai Savings Rate`}</a>{`, which is the primary tool for influencing Dai demand and steering the monetary policy of Dai. Raising the Dai Savings Rate increases the demand for holding Dai; lowering the rate decreases the demand for holding Dai. This ultimately translates to a stable Dai peg.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"stability-fee.md\"\n      }}>{`Stability Fees`}</a>{` for various Vault types are another policy tool that can be used to help Dai stability but are primarily used for covering the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskpremium.asp\"\n      }}>{`risk premium`}</a>{` of different  Vault types. Decreases in a Stability Fee, reflecting the cost of borrowing, can incentivize the additional creation of Dai. Similarly, increasing Stability Fees can reduce the rate of Dai generation.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Arbitrageurs also contribute to the short term stability of the peg by taking advantage of price differences across various Dai markets.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Vault owners are able to participate in maintaining the peg by taking advantage of opportunities when spikes in demand push the Dai price higher than $1. This allows a Vault owner to issue Dai that can be used to purchase assets with an additional variable amount of purchasing power. Inversely, when Dai is trading below a dollar, Vault owners are incentivized to purchase Dai and pay down their Dai balances at a discount.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`How can I generate Dai?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Dai generation only happens through the use of `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"vault.md\"\n      }}>{`Maker Vaults`}</a>{`. The Maker Foundation offers a comfortable user interface for interacting with the Maker Protocol on `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://oasis.app/\"\n      }}>{`Oasis.app`}</a>{`. Users may open and interact with their Vaults on `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://oasis.app/borrow\"\n      }}>{`oasis.app/borrow.`}</a>{` There are a number of other apps that give people access to Maker Vaults; a shortlist can be found in the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://awesome.makerdao.com/#generate-dai\"\n      }}>{`Generate Dai`}</a>{` section of the Awesome MakerDAO resource library.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Where can I buy Dai?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Dai is available on a wide range of centralized and decentralized exchanges. A list of these exchanges can be found in the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://awesome.makerdao.com/#trade-dai\"\n      }}>{`Trade Dai`}</a>{` section of the Awesome-MakerDAO resource repository.
