One way is through the Emergency Shutdown Module(ESM), which allows for a shutdown to be triggered by a minimum number of MKR called the Emergency Shutdown Threshold. Emergency Shutdown may also be triggered through a regular Executive Vote, though the ESM would be a more direct method that does not have to wait for the delay period imposed by the Governance Security Module.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Technical documentation about how the Governance Security Module works can be found in the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/pause-detailed-documentation\"\n      }}>{`Pause - Detailed Documentation`}</a>{` subsection of `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://docs.makerdao.com/\"\n      }}>{`MCD Docs`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`When should Emergency Shutdown be used?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Emergency Shutdown may be used in the cases of attacks on the system, significant economic issues, and major upgrades.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Examples of attacks on the system include hacking or security breaches of the smart contracts, manipulation of the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"oracles.md\"\n      }}>{`Oracles`}</a>{`, and attacks on governance through ratified malicious proposals.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Examples of significant economic issues include the scenario of a severely broken peg (as decided by MKR voters), and other market scenarios if they pose a significant and real threat to a majority of users.`}</p>\n    <p>{`An example of a major technical upgrade that will warrant an Emergency Shutdown is the upgrade to Multi Collateral Dai, as a method to shut down Single Collateral Dai after the transition period. `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"governance.md\"\n      }}>{`Governance`}</a>{` is encouraged to avoid Emergency Shutdown unless absolutely necessary. Technical upgrades of a smaller scale can be done without Emergency Shutdowns.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Does hitting a Debt Ceiling warrant an Emergency Shutdown?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Hitting a Debt Ceiling marks the moment where new Dai cannot be generated by a particular `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"vault.md\"\n      }}>{`Vault`}</a>{` type. This is not an immediate threat to the stability of the system as Dai can still be minted from other Vault types. Additionally, any problems can be mitigated by raising debt ceilings, therefore it is not necessary to perform an Emergency Shutdown on the system. Emergency Shutdown is a very disruptive process and should only be used in cases of last resort and planned upgrades.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Will the redemption of collateral for Vaults and Dai be immediate and automatic, or a manual process?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The redemption of collateral claims will occur manually. After a cooldown period which waits for all collateral auctions to complete, Dai holders will be able to redeem collateral through a series of individual transactions for each collateral type.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Why is there a delay period before Dai holders can redeem collateral?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`When Emergency Shutdown is triggered there may still be `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://docs.makerdao.com/auctions/the-auctions-of-the-maker-protocol\"\n      }}>{`Auctions`}</a>{` running. The delay period gives time for those auctions to settle and for the internal system balances to become final.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Do both Dai holders and Vault owners need to redeem collateral?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Both `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"vault.md\"\n      }}>{`Vault`}</a>{` owners and Dai holders need to redeem collateral. However, they do so in different ways. Vault owners will be able to withdraw all excess collateral, netting them out of their positions as the remaining collateral value is equal to their outstanding generated Dai. Dai holders will go through the main collateral claim process.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`If collateral prices keep falling after the reference prices are frozen, doesn’t that mean people redeeming Dai and closing-out Vaults may experience a haircut?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Yes, it is possible for users to get less than a dollar worth of collateral for their Dai. `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"vault.md\"\n      }}>{`Vault`}</a>{` owners are able to immediately redeem their excess collateral and are less likely to experience a haircut. Dai holders are subject to the volatility of the underlying collateral portfolio after Emergency Shutdown is triggered.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`How quickly can an Emergency Shutdown be performed?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`To trigger an Emergency Shutdown, a minimum threshold of 50,000 MKR must be placed into the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/emergency-shutdown-module\"\n      }}>{`Emergency Shutdown Module(ESM).`}</a>{` Therefore, it depends on how quickly MKR token holders can come together to decide on whether to trigger an Emergency Shutdown. All MKR placed in the ESM is permanently lost, and can only be retrieved after redeployment as a decision of MKR governors.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`What happens to MakerDAO after an Emergency Shutdown?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`After Emergency Shutdown is triggered, the collateral redemption process takes place.
