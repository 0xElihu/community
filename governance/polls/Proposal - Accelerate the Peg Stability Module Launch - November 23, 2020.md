# Poll: Accelerate the Peg Stability Module Launch - November 23, 2020

The MakerDAO Governance Facilitator has placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance community which gives Maker Governance the chance to signal their support or opposition accelerating the PSM launch.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for 3 days beginning on Monday, November 23 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The Peg Stability Module (PSM) can be used to replace the 101% collateralization ratio stablecoin vaults which will reach 100% collateralization by approximately December 18th. Currently the plan is to replace these stablecoin vaults with duplicates as per the [Stablecoin Action Plan](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmY1vJPs?network=mainnet#vote-breakdown) vote from 2 weeks ago. Part way through the vote a new option became available - the PSM, and so I am running this vote to see if MKR holders prefer the PSM instead.

The PSM provides many benefits over the status quo:

 * Restore the peg. We can move the price into a tighter spread because we no longer need to worry about liquidations.
 * Fee collection is up front and exact instead of having to time roll overs at 100% CR.
 * No longer have to worry about liquidations as the PSM will self-unwind when Dai drops below $0.999.
 * Additional profit on the unwinding stage which would previously have gone to vault holders.
 * We enable very large traders to go between Dai and Stablecoins without slippage.

The proposed initial parameters for the PSM are `tin` of 0.1% and a `tout` of 0.1%. To maximize fee collection the `tin` parameter will be initialized at 1% and lowered continuously to 0.1% over the course of a week. We will initially roll the PSM out for USDC, but plan to add support for the other stablecoins pending risk assessments.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-accelerate-the-psm-launch/5094) to further inform your position on this issue before voting.

## Next Steps

If the winning result is yes, then the Domain Teams will prioritize the PSM and aim for a tentative launch date of Friday, December 18th, 2020. A forum post will be made to track the status of technical audits and risk assessment. This action overrides the current Stablecoin Action Plan - Option 3 plan.

If the winning result is no, then we will proceed with Stablecoin Action Plan - Option 3 and run an additional poll to determine the switch date. The PSM can still be added later through the regular monthly MIPs cycle.
