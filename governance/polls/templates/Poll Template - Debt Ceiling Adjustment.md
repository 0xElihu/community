# Poll: Adjust the $ilk_name Debt Ceiling - $date_MONTH_DD,_YYYY

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the $poll_source. The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to adjusting the $ilk_name Debt Ceiling from $current_ceiling million to $new_ceiling million.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on $startdate_DAY,_MONTH_DD_at_H_PM_ZONE.

## Review 

Please review the discussion [thread]($discussion_link) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this change change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. 

If this poll ends with a 'No' majority, then no further action will be taken.

If the Friday executive passes, then this rate change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.
