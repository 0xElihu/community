# Poll: Add a Trigger for ETH-A and USDC-A Debt Ceiling Increases - September 14, 2020

The Maker Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. The community can use this poll to express support or opposition to adding a debt ceiling trigger to ETH-A and USDC-A.

This weekly Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, September 14 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The signal request for adding a debt ceiling trigger for ETH-a and USDC-A can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-add-a-dc-trigger-for-planned-raises/3878/23) along with the results. The signal request for adding a global DAI supply cap can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-limit-vaults-to-a-maximum-of-global-dai-supply/3879). Please review the discussion there to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If this proposal passes the governance poll by Thursday, September 17, 2020 at 16:00 UTC, the following will occur going forward: If ETH-A and USDC-A vaults utilization = 90% on a Friday at 12:00pm UTC, a governance poll will be added by the Governance Facilitators on the following Monday to increase the Debt Ceiling by 20% (rounded to the nearest Million). 

Alternatively if passed, the USDC-A debt ceiling will no longer trigger automatic debt ceiling increase polls if the debt ceiling of USDC-A were to equal 20% of total DAI supply.
