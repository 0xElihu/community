# Poll: Timing Poll to Proceed with the MIPs Ratification Vote - April 27, 2020

## Introduction

Today, on April 27th, 2020, the Maker Community will vote to proceed with the ratification vote for the Initial 13 Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) and 2 Subproposals. The MIPs cover the Core Governance and Collateral Onboarding frameworks as well as two subproposals for onboarding an official MIP Editor and Smart Contracts Domain team.

**The Timing Poll provides the opportunity to select one of the two options listed below:**

1. Yes
1. No

## Review: The 13 Initial MIPs and 2 Subproposals

### The MIPs Framework

**[MIP0 (The Maker Improvement Proposals Framework)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP0):** MIP0 defines and describes the MIPs Framework.

- **[MIP0c12-SP1](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP0/MIP0c12-Subproposals/MIP0c12-SP1.md):** Subproposal for Core Personnel Onboarding (The first MIP Editor).

### Core Foundational MIPs Set

**[MIP1 (Maker Governance Paradigms)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP1):** MIP1 defines and describes Governance Paradigms and problem spaces.

**[MIP2 (Governance Launch Period)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP2):** MIP2 details two interim phases during which logic defined in MIP0 is overridden.

**[MIP3 (Governance Cycle)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP3):** MIP3 defines a monthly Governance Cycle with the aim of providing a predictable framework for Maker governance decisions.

**[MIP4 (MIP Amendment and Removal Process)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP4):** MIP4 defines processes for the amendment and removal of accepted MIPs.

**[MIP5 (Emergency Voting System)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP5):** MIP5 defines emergency changes to the protocol and Governance Facilitator role and how they should be handled in practice.

### Collateral Onboarding MIPs Set

**[MIP6 (Collateral Onboarding Form/Forum Template)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP6):** MIP6 provides an overview of defines a standardized application form used to kick off the process of onboarding a new collateral asset to the Maker Protocol.

**[MIP7 (Domain Teams for Collateral Onboarding)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP7):** MIP7 defines processes for onboarding and offboarding domain teams.

- **[MIP7c3-SP1](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP7/MIP7c3-Subproposals/MIP7c3-SP1.md):** Domain Team Onboarding - Smart Contracts Domain Team. 


**[MIP8 (Domain Greenlight)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP8):** MIP8 defines the process by which domain teams signal that a potential collateral type is worth the time spent investigating its inclusion in the Maker Protocol.

**[MIP9 (Community Greenlight)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP9):** MIP9 defines the process by which MKR Token Holders can signal their judgment on the value of a potential collateral type before domain teams spend time thoroughly investigating its inclusion into the Maker Protocol.


**[MIP10 (Oracle Requirements for Collateral Onboarding)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP10):** MIP10 defines how oracles are onboarded, offboarded, and managed in order to support the collateral onboarding process.

**[MIP11 (Collateral Onboarding Risk Models)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP11):** MIP11 defines the requirements of general risk models and how they are onboarded to and offboarded from the Maker Protocol.

**[MIP12 (Collateral Onboarding and Risk Parameter Adjustment Process Documentation Requirements)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP12):** MIP11 defines the requirements of general risk models and how they are onboarded to and offboarded from the Maker Protocol.

## Next Steps: Timing Poll Outcomes

1. **Approval to proceed with the Ratification Vote**
If the Timing Poll resolves to proceed with the Ratification Vote of the proposed MIPs, the vote will occur over four days, May 1-4. If that vote resolves to “Yes,” the first Governance Cycle will begin on May 4. Once the Governance Cycle has begun, the formal submission of MIPs and Subproposals will occur between May 4 and May 6.

2. **Delay the Ratification Vote for one month**
If the Timing Poll resolves to "no". The Ratification Vote is effectively delayed for one month, where a competition process would begin immediately. The competition process is a MIPs proposal process, where multiple versions of MIPs can be proposed as alternative choices to the intially proposed MIPs. For example, several versions of MIP3, which describe the Governance Cycle, might be presented.

    The deadline for submitting competing proposals would be May 20. The community would then proceed to vote for the proposal version they want to be included in the final MIP Set and put up for the ratification vote. Voting would occur May 23-26.

    Lastly, the final Ratification Vote would begin on May 27 and end on May 30. If the vote resolves to “Yes,” the MIPs will be officially ratified and marked as “Accepted,” and the first Governance Cycle would begin on June 1. Once the Governance Cycle has begun, the formal submission of MIPs and Subproposals will occur between June 1 and June 3.
