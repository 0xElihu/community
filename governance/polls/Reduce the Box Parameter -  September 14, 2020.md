# Poll: Reduce the Box Parameter - September 14, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the community. The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to reducing the `box` parameter from 30 million to 15 million.

The `box` parameter represents the maximum DAI value of collateral that can be auctioned by the Maker protocol simultaneously. In practice this parameter acts as a rate-limit on liquidations.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, 14 September  at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/4023) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

For more details on the `box` parameter and its function, please see this [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/liquidations-1-2-technical-details/3792).

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. 

If this poll ends with a 'No' majority, then no further action will be taken.

If the Friday executive passes, then this rate change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.
