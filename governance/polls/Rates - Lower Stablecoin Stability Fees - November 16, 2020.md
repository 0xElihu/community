# Poll: Lower Stablecoin Stability Fees - November 16, 2020

The MakerDAO Governance Facilitator has placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance community which gives Maker Governance the chance to signal their support for lowering the stablecoin stability fees.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for 3 days beginning on Monday, November 16 at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The [DsChief 1.2 upgrade](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/dschief-1-2-flash-loan-protection-for-maker-governance/5115) will be consuming most of the executives until December 11th. The November 20th executive is the last place to make any changes before this.

We are still in the process of settling whether governance wants to proceed with [Option 3](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmY1vJPs?network=mainnet#vote-breakdown) or the new [PSM option](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-accelerate-the-psm-launch/5094) that just came out this week. Regardless of the eventual outcome, we are racing against the clock here. If we want to proceed with the PSM instead of Option 3 we will likely want to have the CR on the leading stablecoin vaults be more than 100.2% or so to allow for a 0.1% profit to those wanting to move over to the PSM naturally. Additionally, even if we stick with Option 3 the timeline of doing an executive on December 11th was previously [voted down](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQed3Ca?network=mainnet#vote-breakdown) and Dec 18th is problematic as it's so close to the holidays. I'm unclear if MKR holders want to wait another week or two to maximize the fees. I'll be running another governance vote soon to determine the Option 3 timeline, but due to this DsChief upgrade I believe it's a good idea to lower the SFs on stablecoin vaults temporarily to give ourselves some breathing room. We can always adjust them again later, so we will collect the fees one way or another if that is what is desired.

Please note that this is not the same as Option 1b or Option 2 in the Stablecoin Action Plan which are permanent changes.

## Next Steps

The Stability Fees for USDC-A/TUSD-A/PAXUSD-A/GUSD-A will be set to the result of the poll in Friday's executive.

Governance votes will continue to be run over the next few weeks to determine the specifics of either the Stablecoin Action Plan Option 3 or the PSM.
