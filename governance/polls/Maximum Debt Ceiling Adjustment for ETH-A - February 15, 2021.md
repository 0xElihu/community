# Poll: Increase the ETH-A Maximum Debt Ceiling - February 15, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 15 at 16:00 UTC.



## Review 

MKR Token Holders may vote in this poll to keep or adjust the ETH-A [Maximum Debt Ceiling](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/module-dciam/):

* 1500 MM (no change)
* 2000 MM (+500 MM)
* 2500 MM (+1000 MM)

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-adjust-eth-a-dc-iam-line-2021-04/6332) to inform your position on this issue before voting.

## Outcomes

* If a result changing the current setting gains a majority of votes, the ETH-A Maximum Debt Ceiling (also referred as `line`) will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.  
* If the Friday executive passes, then this parameter change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.
