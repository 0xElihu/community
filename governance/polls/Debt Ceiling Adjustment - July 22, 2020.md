# Poll: Adjust the TUSD Debt Ceiling - July 27, 2020

The Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team has placed a Governance Poll into the voting system to alter the TUSD Debt Ceiling. Voters are now able to signal their support to reduce the TUSD Debt Ceiling to 0 from the current value of 2 million. 

This Governance Poll (FAQ) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 27 at 16:00 UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, July 31, at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The initial proposal for reducing the TUSD Debt Ceiling can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3225) along with the signal request results. 

## Next Steps

If this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this change will be included in the Executive Vote on Friday, July 31.

If this poll ends with a 'No' majority, TUSD will be reviewed further by the Smart Contracts team and then voted on again in terms of next steps for risk parameter adjustments.
