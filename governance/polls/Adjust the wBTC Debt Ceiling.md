# Poll: Adjust the wBTC Debt Ceiling - May 11 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which the community can use to decrese the wBTC Debt Ceiling from the current 10M to 3M, or keep it as is.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, May 11 at 5 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting)) which will go live on Friday, May 15, at 5 PM UTC.

## Review

Additional context was presented in a [Forum Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/wbtc-wbtc-collateral-request-for-comment/2135/48) and a [Signal Request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-adjust-wbtc-debt-ceiling/2333) on May 2nd, 2020 and May 3rd, 2020, respectively. Please review to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps
