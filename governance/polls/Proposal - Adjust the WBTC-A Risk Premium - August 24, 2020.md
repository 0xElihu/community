# Poll: WBTC Risk Prmium Adjustment - August 24, 2020

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance Community. The community can use this poll to express support or opposition for a **WTBC Risk Premium** adjustment to 4%.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 24 at 16:00 UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, August 28, at 16:00 UTC.

## Review

The **WBTC Risk Premium** was voted on in a forum signal request. Please review the [Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-change-the-rps-for-various-collateral-types/3484) to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If the winning result of this poll is Yes, then the **WBTC Risk Premium** parametere value in the Maker Protocol change to 4% will be included in the Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. 

If the Friday executive passes, then this rate change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.
