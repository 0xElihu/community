# Poll: WBTC Risk Prmium Adjustment - August 24, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which presents a number of possible **WTBC Risk Premium** options. Voters are now able to signal their support for a **WTBC Risk Premium** within a range of 0% to 6%.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 24 at 4 PM UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, August 28, at 4 PM UTC.

## Review

The **WBTC Risk Premium** was voted on in a forum signal request. Please review the [Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-change-the-rps-for-various-collateral-types/3484) to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If the winning result of this poll differs from the current **WBTC Risk Premium** parameter value in the Maker Protocol then this change will be included in the Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. 

If the Friday executive passes, then this rate change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.
