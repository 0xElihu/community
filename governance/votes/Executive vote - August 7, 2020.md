## [Executive Vote] Increase the WBTC-A debt ceiling

The Governance Facilitators and the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.

### Increase the WBTC-A debt ceiling

As per the community signal request located [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/3519), this proposal asks whether the WBTC-A Debt Ceiling should be increased from 40 million to 80 million. This proposal has successfully met the requirements to be expedited as an emergency action based on the community response within that signal request. 

This expedited action is being taken in response to DAI consistently trading above peg for the past few months.

## Summary

Therefore, if this Executive proposal passes the following will occur:

- The WBTC-A Debt Ceiling will increase from 40 million to 80 million.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
