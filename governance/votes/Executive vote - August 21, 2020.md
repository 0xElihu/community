## [Executive Vote] Activate Liquidations 1.2, Increase the Base Rate

The Governance Facilitators and the Maker Foundation Smart Contracts Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.

### Activate Liquidations 1.2

As per the non-standard weekly [poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmzaapfn5wxrqpk8pej9bepw1gxufmmndw96kgeufomjvd), the Liquidations 1.2 upgrade will be activated and included within the Maker Protocol if this proposal passes.

Liquidations 1.2 has been described in detail on the forum [here] https://forum.makerdao.com/t/liquidations-system-1-2-upgrade-timeline/3592 and a presentation was given on the weekly Governance and Risk meeting which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/fPpCmrSkWPY?t=1911). Please reveiw these resources to inform your position before voting. 

### Increase the Base Rate

As per the weekly Base Rate[poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmxsvxuukus5ngdfy4wcysbrzr1j3gens8o8axfkdheoca) the [Base Rate](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/discussion-change-the-stability-fee-structure/2258) meta-parameter will be increased from -6% to -4% if this proposal passes.

Stability Fees are calculated from the Base Rate and Risk Premiums using the formula `Stability Fee = max(Base Rate + Risk Premium, 0%)`. **Please note that a negative Base Rate does NOT imply negative Stability Fees**.

## Summary

- 
- The Base Rate meta-parameter will be increased from -6% to -4%.
- The USDC-B Stability Fee parameter will be increased from 44% to 46%.
