## [Executive Vote] Lower the Base Rate, raise the WBTC Debt Ceiling and Risk Premium

The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol as outlined in these Polls:

- [Raise the WBTC Debt Ceiling and Risk Premium](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmzbjhbvompj77ud2yw3f1zatxgitt72q7cukx3mqtath9)
- [Lower the Base Rate from 0% to 0.25%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmyyuvc3fphgt9bqotkedijxt5mpnjfktz/3je9c2cspfae)

Therefor, voting for this Executive will:

- Raise the WBTC-A Debt Ceiling from 10 million to 20 million
- Raise the WBTC-A Risk Premium from 1% to 2%
- Lower the Base Rate from 0.25% to 0% which will set the following Stability Fees:
  - ETH-A: **0.0%**
  - WBTC-A: **1%**
  - BAT-A: **0.0%**
  - KNC-A: **4%**
  - ZRX-A: **4%**
  - USDC-A: **0.75%**
  - USDC-B: **50%**
  - TUSD-A: **0%**

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
