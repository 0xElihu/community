## State of the Peg

[http://dai.descipher.io/](http://dai.descipher.io/)



*   Dai remains slightly above peg at ~1.008. 
*   Eth price fluctuations generally keep an inverse correlation. If vault owners are unsure about Eth’s price they are even less sure about opening leveraged positions.
*   WBTC Debt Ceiling close to cap, waiting on a signalling post for any changes.
*   Longer term rising trend in ETH vaults but short term additions mirror Eth volatility.

# Feedback


#### Feedback and room for improvement

Survey link


### **_Ideas_**

Philosophy Corner (a.k.a. The Dao of DAOs)

Meme alley. All things memes, salt and shit posts. Post your memes here.

Add ecosystem builder (Scale to interview someone building with Dai every other week)

Add ecosystem participant (anonymous from twitter)

Add “Meet a Maker” section, could be someone at Foundation but could also be ecosystem partner who wants some forum exposure.

“Knowledge Pill” each week: explain a part of the system, once a week.

I’d be aware of length when writing this newsletter, especially if it’s once a week. Want to hit a good balance of stuff that people will want to read, and useful links. 


#### Content Strategy

Goal: To aggregate and promote information and news relevant to MakerDAO PR to the DAO.
