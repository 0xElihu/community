# Governance

The Dai Credit System is fully controlled by MKR token holders through on-chain voting. In order to encourage a healthy voting community, which fosters participation in public discussions and voting based on scientific governance, the Community Development Group at the Maker Foundation has put together a number of resources that MKR token holders can use to help themselves stay up to date and make informed decisions.
