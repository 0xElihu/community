# Community Development at MakerDAO

The Community Development group's mandate is to directly foster the growth of the MakerDAO ecosystem by incentivizing our most motivated members. We do this through a series of initiatives designed to create direct incentives and support structures that allow people to participate in, and contribute to, the success of the Dai Stablecoin platform.

## The Initiatives

### [Awesome-MakerDAO](https://github.com/makerdao/awesome-makerdao/)

Awesome-MakerDAO is a community curated list of resources and content that anyone is welcome to contribute towards. It is a collection of resources for anyone interested in exploring MakerDao. You can find everything from official documentation, to beginner guides, analysis pieces, tools, partnership announcements, AMAs, podcasts, 3rd party apps, and much more.

### [Community Meetups & MicroGrants](meetups/)

Community members are incredibly important to MakerDAO and play a valuable role in building a stronger ecosystem. The Community Development Group wants to provide the resources you need to increase Dai adoption and help us bring stability and financial inclusion to the masses. To do this we have created a DIY Meetup guide and micro-granting program dedicated to helping anyone create and organize a local community meetup. 

### [Community Translations](translations/)

Our goal is to bring MakerDAO educational content to people around the world in their native languages by incentivizing our community with Dai bounties. 

### [FAQs](faqs/)

We welcome you to help improve the MakerDAO FAQs by submitting Pull Requests or reaching out to us with feedback.

### [Governance](governance/)

In bootstrapping Governance, we've set up this section to hold helpful resources such as transcripts of the meetings, historical summaries, and more. 

### [Grants Program](grants/)

One of the most important initiatives at MakerDAO is identifying and incentivizing third-party talent to contribute to the Maker ecosystem. The initial iteration of this granting process is dedicated to bootstrapping projects with small to midsize grants. The allocated funds are only released when teams reach predetermined milestones. Successful projects may also gain access to internal consulting resources.

### [Hackathons](hackathons/)

MakerDAO participates in a number of Hackathons every year. This section contains some information about how to request that we participate in an upcoming hackathon, as well as a Hackathon Winners page where we acknowlege winners of MakerDAO sponsored prizes. 

### How to get involved
