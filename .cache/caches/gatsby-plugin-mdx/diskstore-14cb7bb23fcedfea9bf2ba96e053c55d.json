One way is through the Emergency Shutdown Module(ESM), which allows for a shutdown to be triggered by a minimum number of MKR called the Emergency Shutdown Threshold.

This is not an immediate threat to the stability of the system as Dai can still be minted from other Vault types. Additionally, any problems can be mitigated by raising debt ceilings, therefore it is not necessary to perform an Emergency Shutdown on the system. Emergency Shutdown is a very disruptive process and should only be used in cases of last resort and planned upgrades.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Will the redemption of collateral for Vaults and Dai be immediate and automatic, or a manual process?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The redemption of collateral claims will occur manually.

However, they do so in different ways.

Dai holders will go through the main collateral claim process.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`If collateral prices keep falling after the reference prices are frozen, doesn’t that mean people redeeming Dai and closing-out Vaults may experience a haircut?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Yes, it is possible for users to get less than a dollar worth of collateral for their Dai. `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"vault.md\"\n      }}>{`Vault`}</a>{` owners are able to immediately redeem their excess collateral and are less likely to experience a haircut.
