Finally, the more votes there are on the current state of the system, the more secure the system generally is from any \"rogue\" proposals.`}</p>\n    <p>{`MKR token holders are tasked with maintaining the health of the system and the stability of the peg while defending against any proposals that seem antithetical to the prudent governance of the system. If a proposal is introduced that MKR holders recognize as beneficial, then the majority of tokens may shift to this new proposal and implement it as the new state of the system.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In this model, the continuity of staked votes challenges and reinforces the status quo of the system through movements of the majority of votes between the most recent successful proposal and new proposals.

As the state of the system is continuously active, it requires continuous governance. At any time a competing proposal to the system could be introduced. If MKR token holders do not agree with the new proposal, then they should cast their votes for the current state of the system (or leave MKR there if they were already voting for the current state), implying that they do not want to see anything changed.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The continuity of the system is emphasized in the fact that a new proposal can be submitted at any time.

To vote, MKR owners must \"lock-up\" tokens by transferring them into the Voting Contract. \"Locked\" MKR can be withdrawn at any time.`}</p>\n    <p>{`MKR token holders have the option to set up their Voting Contract with a single hot or cold wallet, or, as a linked wallet, as a more secure option. The linked wallet setup allows users to vote using a hot wallet, with MKR stored on a cold wallet.\nSetting up a Voting Contract is a one-time action as long as the same wallet or wallets are used in future voting. However, to use a different hot or cold wallet, the contract can be discontinued and set up again at any time.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`How do I know my vote was placed?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The voter's current vote is displayed on a given proposal page in the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://vote.makerdao.com/\"\n      }}>{`voting portal`}</a>{`.

For example, if 50 stakeholders hold a total of 600 MKR and vote for proposal A, while 100 stakeholders hold a total of 400 MKR and vote for proposal B, then Proposal A would win with 60% of the vote.

The linked setup does not allow the MKR to be transferred to any address apart from the cold wallet. A voter can avoid the need to directly access their cold wallet, making it more convenient and secure to participate. If a voter's hot wallet is compromised, the attacker may vote with their MKR, but will not be able to steal it.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`When setting up a linked wallet, what permissions am I granting?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The permissions enable a number of things technically. All of which enable the MKR in a cold wallet to be deposited into the voting contract, while giving permission to the hot wallet to use it solely for voting and withdrawing back to the cold wallet.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Does it cost gas every time I vote?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Yes.

The voting is then done by continuous approval voting, where users receive IOU tokens in exchange for their MKR. This is useful for secondary governance mechanisms, allowing users to continue to vote on governance polls and executive votes without unlocking their MKR. Note that IOU tokens may not be exchanged for the locked MKR tokens except by the individuals who have actually locked funds in the contract itself, and only up to the amount they have locked.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`When setting up a linked wallet, how many transactions do I have to sign?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`It takes five separate transactions to set up the voting contract.`}</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Initiate link:`}</strong>{` The first step is to specify which wallet to use as the hot wallet.
