While some Vault types are permissionless others may carry requirements.

Any Vault with Generated Dai has a Liquidation Price, the price of the underlying asset at which one's Vault would be liquidated. Using a Vault for leverage introduces additional risk. The potential for reward is higher through leverage, but the potential for loss is magnified as well. It is a common practice among users to maintain a high Collateralization Ratio to protect from Market Risks and thereby Liquidation.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`User Risks:`}</strong>{` These are risks associated with user errors.
