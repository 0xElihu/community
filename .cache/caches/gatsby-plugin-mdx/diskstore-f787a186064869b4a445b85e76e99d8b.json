The first and only reliable economic incentive for MKR token holders is to safeguard and increase the value of the MKR token. While this does mean that the driving motive for MKR token holders is that of profit, this self-interest is directed by the Maker Protocol into positive outcomes for all economic participants. `}</p>\n    <p>{`It’s important to remember however, that this economic incentive is rarely the only incentive acting upon MKR token holders. While some tokens are held institutionally, others are held by individuals and not all individuals are driven primarily by a profit motive. In addition, it is possible for MKR token holders to act maliciously, with outside incentives to see the Maker Protocol fail. This is an unavoidable risk but it is guarded against to the fullest extent possible by the principle of scientific governance and the mechanisms of the Maker Protocol.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Despite the individual variations in personal incentives and the risk of malicious MKR, the unifying incentive is that of protecting and increasing the value of the MKR token. All governance discussions should be viewed through this lense and with this objective in mind.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Stability`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Maintaining the stability of the Dai stablecoin is one of the primary reasons for MKR governance to exist. As such, it is hardly a surprise to learn that this is one of the most commonly discussed topics among the governance community. The primary product of the Maker Protocol is the stablecoin Dai. If Dai is not kept stable, it is not an effective stablecoin and it will not be used by the market at large.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Market usage of Dai is critical to MKR token holders because more Dai usage equates to more incoming Vault Fees. Vault Fees are the largest source of income for the Maker Protocol, directly causing MKR to be burned so long as the protocol has a net-positive income.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Stability of the Dai stablecoin is controlled through two mechanisms, the Stability Fee, and the Dai Savings Rate. The specific value for each of these parameters is voted on regularly and the outcomes of these votes are often a source of discussion within the governance community.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Security`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Without a functioning Maker Protocol, the MKR token has no value. The security of the Maker Protocol, and by extension, security of the value of the MKR token itself, is of paramount importance.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Any potential risks to the correct and secure functioning of the Maker Protocol are issues of urgency for MKR token holders. This is true whether they are technical issues with smart contract implementation, issues with oracles, or even crypto-economic governance attacks from malicious MKR token holders.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It is also important for the governance community to consider the risks to the Maker Protocol that are inherited from the Ethereum blockchain itself. As Ethereum develops and evolves, MKR token holders will need to discuss and manage this inherited risk. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`Risk Management`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Due to the nature of the Maker Protocol, some risks cannot be eliminated and must instead be managed.
