Liquidation is the process of selling collateral to cover a user’s generated Dai. A Vault can be Liquidated if the value of its collateral falls below the required minimum level, called the Liquidation Ratio. During the Liquidation process, enough collateral is sold to cover the debt along with a Liquidation Penalty, leaving the remaining collateral available for withdrawal.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Why does Liquidation exist?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Dai is a proxy for the US Dollar, with the additional benefit of being fully backed by real value in the form of various collateral assets.

These Keepers are a special category of Maker Protocol users. They are the actors in the system who are incentivized to make sure that the outstanding Dai supply remains fully collateralized and solvent. They help maintain the health of the entire ecosystem by ensuring that undercollateralized Vaults are offered up for Liquidation as quickly as possible.

Ensuring that assets remain safe from Liquidation is entirely in the hands of each Vault owner. Below are some common practices to monitor the health of a Vault:`}</p>\n    <p>{`Vault owners could:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Set up price alerts for the collateral asset(s) being used.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Set up a personal rule that would require them to unwind their Vaults if the collateral price falls below a certain level, this may act as an additional buffer.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Make sure they have adequate access to their Vaults, especially during volatile periods in the markets.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Keep note of their Vault’s number. They can use it as a reference to have an external party payback Dai or add collateral on their behalf if they don’t have immediate access to their Vault.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Make sure they have access to emergency funds or assets that can be readily used to pay back Dai or add more collateral to their positions.`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`Remember that opening a Vault and generating Dai represents the creation of risk. Vault owners should be very cognizant of this fact and should use Vaults at their own risk.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`How would a flash crash affect the Liquidation of Vaults?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`A flash crash on a single exchange will not affect the system as each `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"oracles.md\"\n      }}>{`Oracle`}</a>{` aggregates prices from many sources.
