It uses Git, a version control system, to track and log changes to the source code, and display that history front and center.\n\nMakerDAO uses [GitHub](https://github.com/) for transparent project planning, visible collaboration, and hosting canonical information. It houses all of MakerDAO's documentation and day-to-day work.\n\nComm-Dev takes advantage of GitHub's robust graphic user interface (GUI) for Git; opening issues, and managing content files are the bulk of the work. MakerDAO uses a simple Git branching model, where one party manages the master branch and reviews all changes before adding them.\n\nCheck out this short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E) for a brief intro to GitHub.\n\n:exclamation: **New Users** :exclamation:\n\n***Lost and have no idea how GitHub works?***\n*The tutorials in [Getting Started 101](#getting-started-101) below are a great place to start. They cover many of GitHub's functions used for Comm-Dev. Set aside some time to go through them.*\n\nExperienced users can skip ahead to [Community GitHub Overview](#community-github-overview).\n\n### Getting Started 101\n\n1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).\n1. Go through the comprehensive, interactive tutorials on [GitHub Lab](https://lab.github.com).\n    - Set aside a few hours to complete the tutorials.\n1. Click [Find Your First Course](https://lab.github.com/login/github).\n    - Follow prompts to install GitHub Learning Lab to personal repositories.\n1. Go through the introductory learning paths.\n    - [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)\n    - [First Day on GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/paths/first-day-on-github)\n    - [First Week on GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/paths/first-week-on-github)\n\n***Pro Tip:** Consider installing [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Most GitHub functions are available online, but some actions (e.g., uploading images) are more straightforward with GitHub Desktop.*\n\n### Community GitHub Overview\n\nThe [MakerDAO Community Repository](https://github.com/makerdao/community) is the collection of documents and resources relating to initiatives from the Community Development group at MakerDAO.\n\n#### Project Tracking\n\n- **[Issues](https://github.com/makerdao/community/issues)**\n  - Issues contain short, actionable descriptions of tasks.\n- **[Labels](https://github.com/makerdao/community/labels)**\n  - Labels loosely define a document to a subgroup. They typically autofill when assigning an issue (e.g., languages or bounties or hackathons).\n- **[Project Board](https://github.com/makerdao/community/projects)**\n  - This Board reflects the development stages based on the current workflow.\n  - Project Boards use a [Kanban layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) to move issues through the columns as they progress.\n    - **Icebox:** Issues that are not active for longer than 60 days.\n    - **Backlog:** Issues that are blocked or not currently active.\n    - **In Progress:** Issues that someone is already tackling.\n    - **Ready for Review:** Issues that need to be reviewed or merged.\n    - **Done:** Issues automatically move here when the issue is closed, or the PR is merged.\n- **[Epics](https://github.com/makerdao/community#workspaces/community-development-5d2475bd23b522535e2def1d/board?filterLogic=any&repos=166580993)**\n  - Epics map to a larger task by nesting multiple issues.\n  - For users that don't have Zenhub, Comm-Dev writes \"Epic\" on one main issue, and includes relevant links.\n  - Epics are more visible with Zenhub.\n    - **Optional:** Download the [Zenhub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd) extension.\n\n#### Best Practices\n\n***Pro Tip:** Practice in a test environment first to prevent merging issues down the road. Fork the Maker Community repository (repo) or clone it to a local machine.*\n\n- Discuss efforts, blockers, and problems in [#community-development](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development).\n- Ensure repositories are up to date.\n- Make a practice branch for edits and approvals.\n  - Fetch the most recent changes.\n  - Branch the main repo to create PRs.\n- Create a new issue or find an existing issue.\n  - Include links and dependencies in the issue description.\n  - Close completed issues manually to mark them as done.\n    - It will move within the project board automatically.\n- Commit early and commit often.\n  - Submit changes before large merges.\n  - Make sure commits are explicit in their changes.\n- Link Pull Requests to existing issues.\n  - If unsure of which issue, ask in the [#community-development](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development) channel.\n- Pull Requests often go through several phases of review before a merge.\n  - An Approver may request changes if a submission does not adhere to guidelines or if it needs general revision.\n  - When reviewing or addressing change requests, indicate which issues are resolved and update them in the PR thread, either issue by issue, or in one summary comment.\n\n### Tips and Visual Guides\n\nClick the links in this section for short animated examples of key GitHub actions useful for Comm-Dev work. Alternatively, scroll through this [GIF gallery](https://imgur.com/a/eeO7OJM) to quickly see all the expedient demos below in one place.\n\n- Clone a repository.\n  - **Example:** [Cloning a GitHub Repository](https://imgur.com/GjX6cf9)\n  - Make sure to have the [repository's URL](repository-url.png)\n- Sync the Comm-Dev repo when it's already on the machine with the Fetch Origin Master button.\n    - In the command line, this is called: `$ git fetch`.\n  - **Example:** [Fetch Origin Master](https://imgur.com/VREFUKV)\n- Use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to simplify uploading images.\n- Create distinct branches to later merge changes into the master.\n- Make branch names short.\n  - **Example:** [Upload image locally and create branch name](https://imgur.com/WJ460E8)\n- Rename any incorrectly named files.\n    - Make sure filenames on GitHub include dashes instead of spaces.\n        - GitHub and GitBooks cannot manage links to files with strange characters (e.g., spaces).\n        - See the [naming files](#naming-files-and-versions) section above.\n  - **Example:** [Rename a file and pushing it to a local branch](https://imgur.com/EXwsHzA)\n- GitHub desktop opens Pull Requests in the GitHub web GUI.\n  - **Example:** [Opening a PR with GitHub Desktop](https://imgur.com/iRYNBC4)\n  - **Note:** In the above example, Git tracked all file uploads, compiled each local change (commit) into one PR, and [merged the Pull Request](https://imgur.com/FFIo7nB).\n- Add a file on GitHub’s GUI by opening another Pull Request.\n  - Pull Requests merge any changes tracked in Git, similar to file uploads.\n  - **Example:** [Add a file with GitHub](https://imgur.com/D3025qz)\n- Comm-Dev uses issues to track work.\n  - **Example:** [Opening an Issue](https://imgur.com/MGW0mMJ)\n- Link Pull Requests to the open issue if resolving the issue requires uploading a file.\n  - **Example:** [Uploading a file and closing an issue](https://imgur.com/Kl5LtmQ)\n- Consider this screenshot example of a [Pull Request](github-fixing-a-commit.png) on the Comm-Dev repo with multiple annotations, commits, and requests for changes.\n    - Key points are labeled:\n        1. Multiple commits.\n        2. Connect Pull Request to the issue.\n        3. The approver requests changes.\n        4. The change request asks to fix relative pathing.\n        **Note:** Correctly defining relative paths to files within a repo is a common problem.\n            - Depending on where in the repo the file lives, a relative path may involve:\n                - **Full Stops:** `.`\n                - **Slashes:** `/`\n            - For files in the same folder:\n                - Write the file name or use a full stop with a slash`./`.\n                - **Example:** `file-name.md`\n                - **Example:** `./file-name.md`\n            - To navigate to a file one folder up:\n                - Use two full stops with a slash `../`\n                - **Example:** `../contributing/file-one-folder-up.md`\n        5. Final comments.\n- If changes are correct, comment on the request and \"resolve\" the comments.\n- After addressing all change requests, comment on the PR to notify the Approver that it’s time to merge.\n\n### Other Helpful Resources\n\n- Check out [Getting Started](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github) on GitHub Help.\n  - See [Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/categories/writing-on-github) for writing and formatting tips.\n- Check out these recommended introductory videos:\n  - [Git & GitHub Crash Course For Beginners](https://youtu.be/SWYqp7iY_Tc)\n  - [Git Tutorials by Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTuRUfjRe54Eea17-YfnOOAx)\n- Check out these other introductory guides:\n  - [Git-The Simple Guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)\n  - [Think like a Git](http://think-like-a-git.net/)\n\n#### Cheat Sheets\n\n- [Git Cheat Sheet by GitHub](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)\n- [A Dead Simple GitSheet](https://gitsheet.wtf/)\n- [Git-Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/)\n- [Interactive Cheat Sheet by NDP](https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=workspace;)\n\n#### Visual Guides\n\n- [Git Workflow](http://justinhileman.info/article/git-pretty/git-pretty.png)\n- [Visualizing Git](http://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3/#)\n-->","position":{"start":{"line":107,"column":1,"offset":3727},"end":{"line":257,"column":4,"offset":13423},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"export","value":"export const _frontmatter = {\"title\":\"How to Use GitHub For One-off Changes\",\"order\":4,\"keywords\":\"makerdao, GitHub, edit\",\"description\":\"A simple guide to GitHub by the MakerDAO Community Development team.\",\"hideLanguageSelector\":true}","position":{"start":{"line":260,"column":1,"offset":13426},"end":{"line":260,"column":237,"offset":13662},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":260,"column":237,"offset":13662}}},"scopeImports":["import * as React from 'react'"],"scopeIdentifiers":["React"],"body":"function _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1;

It uses Git, a version control system, to track and log changes to the source code, and display that history front and center.\n      MakerDAO uses [GitHub](https://github.com/) for transparent project planning, visible collaboration, and hosting canonical information. It houses all of MakerDAO's documentation and day-to-day work.\n      Comm-Dev takes advantage of GitHub's robust graphic user interface (GUI) for Git; opening issues, and managing content files are the bulk of the work. MakerDAO uses a simple Git branching model, where one party manages the master branch and reviews all changes before adding them.\n      Check out this short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E) for a brief intro to GitHub.\n      :exclamation: **New Users** :exclamation:\n      ***Lost and have no idea how GitHub works?***\n      *The tutorials in [Getting Started 101](#getting-started-101) below are a great place to start. They cover many of GitHub's functions used for Comm-Dev. Set aside some time to go through them.*\n      Experienced users can skip ahead to [Community GitHub Overview](#community-github-overview).\n      ### Getting Started 101\n      1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).\n      1. Go through the comprehensive, interactive tutorials on [GitHub Lab](https://lab.github.com).\n         - Set aside a few hours to complete the tutorials.\n      1. Click [Find Your First Course](https://lab.github.com/login/github).\n         - Follow prompts to install GitHub Learning Lab to personal repositories.\n      1. Go through the introductory learning paths.\n         - [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)\n         - [First Day on GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/paths/first-day-on-github)\n         - [First Week on GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/paths/first-week-on-github)\n      ***Pro Tip:** Consider installing [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Most GitHub functions are available online, but some actions (e.g., uploading images) are more straightforward with GitHub Desktop.*\n      ### Community GitHub Overview\n      The [MakerDAO Community Repository](https://github.com/makerdao/community) is the collection of documents and resources relating to initiatives from the Community Development group at MakerDAO.\n      #### Project Tracking\n      - **[Issues](https://github.com/makerdao/community/issues)**\n       - Issues contain short, actionable descriptions of tasks.\n      - **[Labels](https://github.com/makerdao/community/labels)**\n       - Labels loosely define a document to a subgroup. They typically autofill when assigning an issue (e.g., languages or bounties or hackathons).\n      - **[Project Board](https://github.com/makerdao/community/projects)**\n       - This Board reflects the development stages based on the current workflow.\n       - Project Boards use a [Kanban layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) to move issues through the columns as they progress.\n         - **Icebox:** Issues that are not active for longer than 60 days.\n         - **Backlog:** Issues that are blocked or not currently active.\n         - **In Progress:** Issues that someone is already tackling.\n         - **Ready for Review:** Issues that need to be reviewed or merged.\n         - **Done:** Issues automatically move here when the issue is closed, or the PR is merged.\n      - **[Epics](https://github.com/makerdao/community#workspaces/community-development-5d2475bd23b522535e2def1d/board?filterLogic=any&repos=166580993)**\n       - Epics map to a larger task by nesting multiple issues.\n       - For users that don't have Zenhub, Comm-Dev writes \"Epic\" on one main issue, and includes relevant links.\n       - Epics are more visible with Zenhub.\n         - **Optional:** Download the [Zenhub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd) extension.\n      #### Best Practices\n      ***Pro Tip:** Practice in a test environment first to prevent merging issues down the road. Fork the Maker Community repository (repo) or clone it to a local machine.*\n      - Discuss efforts, blockers, and problems in [#community-development](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development).\n      - Ensure repositories are up to date.\n      - Make a practice branch for edits and approvals.\n       - Fetch the most recent changes.\n       - Branch the main repo to create PRs.\n      - Create a new issue or find an existing issue.\n       - Include links and dependencies in the issue description.\n       - Close completed issues manually to mark them as done.\n         - It will move within the project board automatically.\n      - Commit early and commit often.\n       - Submit changes before large merges.\n       - Make sure commits are explicit in their changes.\n      - Link Pull Requests to existing issues.\n       - If unsure of which issue, ask in the [#community-development](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development) channel.\n      - Pull Requests often go through several phases of review before a merge.\n       - An Approver may request changes if a submission does not adhere to guidelines or if it needs general revision.\n       - When reviewing or addressing change requests, indicate which issues are resolved and update them in the PR thread, either issue by issue, or in one summary comment.\n      ### Tips and Visual Guides\n      Click the links in this section for short animated examples of key GitHub actions useful for Comm-Dev work. Alternatively, scroll through this [GIF gallery](https://imgur.com/a/eeO7OJM) to quickly see all the expedient demos below in one place.\n      - Clone a repository.\n       - **Example:** [Cloning a GitHub Repository](https://imgur.com/GjX6cf9)\n       - Make sure to have the [repository's URL](repository-url.png)\n      - Sync the Comm-Dev repo when it's already on the machine with the Fetch Origin Master button.\n         - In the command line, this is called: `$ git fetch`.\n       - **Example:** [Fetch Origin Master](https://imgur.com/VREFUKV)\n      - Use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to simplify uploading images.\n      - Create distinct branches to later merge changes into the master.\n      - Make branch names short.\n       - **Example:** [Upload image locally and create branch name](https://imgur.com/WJ460E8)\n      - Rename any incorrectly named files.\n         - Make sure filenames on GitHub include dashes instead of spaces.\n             - GitHub and GitBooks cannot manage links to files with strange characters (e.g., spaces).\n             - See the [naming files](#naming-files-and-versions) section above.\n       - **Example:** [Rename a file and pushing it to a local branch](https://imgur.com/EXwsHzA)\n      - GitHub desktop opens Pull Requests in the GitHub web GUI.\n       - **Example:** [Opening a PR with GitHub Desktop](https://imgur.com/iRYNBC4)\n       - **Note:** In the above example, Git tracked all file uploads, compiled each local change (commit) into one PR, and [merged the Pull Request](https://imgur.com/FFIo7nB).\n      - Add a file on GitHub’s GUI by opening another Pull Request.\n       - Pull Requests merge any changes tracked in Git, similar to file uploads.\n       - **Example:** [Add a file with GitHub](https://imgur.com/D3025qz)\n      - Comm-Dev uses issues to track work.\n       - **Example:** [Opening an Issue](https://imgur.com/MGW0mMJ)\n      - Link Pull Requests to the open issue if resolving the issue requires uploading a file.\n       - **Example:** [Uploading a file and closing an issue](https://imgur.com/Kl5LtmQ)\n      - Consider this screenshot example of a [Pull Request](github-fixing-a-commit.png) on the Comm-Dev repo with multiple annotations, commits, and requests for changes.\n         - Key points are labeled:\n             1. Multiple commits.\n             2. Connect Pull Request to the issue.\n             3. The approver requests changes.\n             4. The change request asks to fix relative pathing.\n             **Note:** Correctly defining relative paths to files within a repo is a common problem.\n                 - Depending on where in the repo the file lives, a relative path may involve:\n                     - **Full Stops:** `.`\n                     - **Slashes:** `/`\n                 - For files in the same folder:\n                     - Write the file name or use a full stop with a slash`./`.\n                     - **Example:** `file-name.md`\n                     - **Example:** `./file-name.md`\n                 - To navigate to a file one folder up:\n                     - Use two full stops with a slash `../`\n                     - **Example:** `../contributing/file-one-folder-up.md`\n             5. Final comments.\n      - If changes are correct, comment on the request and \"resolve\" the comments.\n      - After addressing all change requests, comment on the PR to notify the Approver that it’s time to merge.\n      ### Other Helpful Resources\n      - Check out [Getting Started](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github) on GitHub Help.\n       - See [Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/categories/writing-on-github) for writing and formatting tips.\n      - Check out these recommended introductory videos:\n       - [Git & GitHub Crash Course For Beginners](https://youtu.be/SWYqp7iY_Tc)\n       - [Git Tutorials by Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTuRUfjRe54Eea17-YfnOOAx)\n      - Check out these other introductory guides:\n       - [Git-The Simple Guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)\n       - [Think like a Git](http://think-like-a-git.net/)\n      #### Cheat Sheets\n      - [Git Cheat Sheet by GitHub](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)\n      - [A Dead Simple GitSheet](https://gitsheet.wtf/)\n      - [Git-Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/)\n      - [Interactive Cheat Sheet by NDP](https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=workspace;)\n      #### Visual Guides\n      - [Git Workflow](http://justinhileman.info/article/git-pretty/git-pretty.png)\n      - [Visualizing Git](http://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3/#)\n      */\n    }\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
