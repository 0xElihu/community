We have assumed that $125 of gold would be sufficient to cover the $100 loan. What about a $1m loan? Well we know the amount of collateral we would need is $1.25m, but getting rid of $1.25m in gold is a more complicated problem than getting rid of $125 of gold. We have to consider the liquidity of the market yet again. `}</p>\n      <p>{`What is required is an adjustment of the collateral value to compensate for liquidity risk. If we assume the liquidity adjustment is 1.15 or an increase of 15% in value.

If the loan is for longer than a day, then more collateral needs to be posted or an adjustment to the collateral needs to be performed on a daily basis. `}</p>\n      <p>{`Considering the loans in MakerDAO are open-ended, we don't need a massive amount of collateral.
