It will then introduce the concept of ‘decentralized risk management’. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The second part of the section will address how decentralized risk management is initiated and implemented by the first risk team, a template model team, the internal risk team of the Maker Foundation. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The last part puts it all together for Maker token holders, by mapping out the decisions that Maker holders will need to make, the support that Maker holders will get to make those decisions and the voting process to follow to manage the risk function. It is the objective of this series to gain an understanding of the risk management function and the contribution Maker token holders make in managing it.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Stablecoins`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Stablecoins are crypto-assets that aim to maintain value relative to a specific asset or basket of assets.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The stability implied in the name is created through a mechanism of dynamics that attempt to keep the value of the token steady with some given reference point. `}</p>\n    <p>{`In most instances, that reference point is the United States dollar but could be extended to any other asset (Euro) or index (CPI).`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Types of Stablecoins`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Currently, three mechanisms or types of stablecoin have transpired that attempt to implement this:`}</p>\n    <List mdxType=\"List\">\n      <Box mdxType=\"Box\">\n        <h4>{`IOU`}</h4>\n        <p>{`The IOU organization is asking the user to place their trust in the traditional centralized system;give them an asset (usually a $1), they will keep it with a centralized custodian and will provide you with a token in return.

The user explicitly trusts that the custodian will look after its assets.`}</p>\n      </Box>\n      <Box mdxType=\"Box\">\n        <h4>{`Seigniorage Shares`}</h4>\n        <p>{`Seigniorage share or Algorithm-based stablecoin solutions ask the user to place their trust with them.

If the user believes that the economy of the blockchain will flourish then so will the tokens on the blockchain.

Put another way, it provides loans and attempts to mitigate credit risk at the same time.`}</p>\n    <h4>{`Collateralized Debt Position - The Engine of Supply`}</h4>\n    <p>{`A Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) is a smart contract designed to minimize credit risk and facilitate collateralization.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Credit or counterparty risk is the risk that a borrower will default on their debt. To mitigate the risk associated with borrowers defaulting, lenders ask for recourse in the form of collateral to be paid before borrowing money.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Collateralization is a fundamental tool used throughout the traditional finance space to minimize or mitigate credit risk. Collateralization occurs when a borrower pledges an asset as recourse to the lender in the event of default on that loan.`}</p>\n    <h4>{`Pledge-of-Assets and Event-of-Default`}</h4>\n    <p>{`A CDP encapsulates these two ideas and turns the fundamental notion of a credit facility into a Dai supplying mechanism.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Assets pledged as collateral need to be unencumbered and accessible to the lender, meaning the lender can take possession and store the collateral somewhere in the event it needs to be seized. `}</p>\n    <p>{`There is an industry dedicated to this process of pledging assets, ensuring they remain unencumbered, and warehousing them appropriately. This is all done in almost an instant with a CDP.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Defining \"Event-of-Default,\" recognizing when it happens, and taking the appropriate action is again an industry in the traditional space.
