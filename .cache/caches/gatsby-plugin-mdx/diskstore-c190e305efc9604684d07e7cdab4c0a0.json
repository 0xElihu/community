Rather, it maintains a free-floating peg that experiences extremely low volatility against the US dollar.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It achieves this stability through a combination of external market forces, complementary internal economic incentives, and policy tools controlled by MKR token holders. Many different market actors behaving in their own self-interest, yet working in concert, contribute to its stability. These actors include MKR holders, arbitrageurs, Vault owners, Keepers, and market makers.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If Dai demand consistently exceeds Dai supply, or vice-versa, it creates a signal that MKR holders need to adjust the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"dsr.md\"\n      }}>{`Dai Savings Rate`}</a>{`, which is the primary tool for influencing Dai demand and steering the monetary policy of Dai. Raising the Dai Savings Rate increases the demand for holding Dai; lowering the rate decreases the demand for holding Dai.

Decreases in a Stability Fee, reflecting the cost of borrowing, can incentivize the additional creation of Dai. Similarly, increasing Stability Fees can reduce the rate of Dai generation.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Arbitrageurs also contribute to the short term stability of the peg by taking advantage of price differences across various Dai markets.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Vault owners are able to participate in maintaining the peg by taking advantage of opportunities when spikes in demand push the Dai price higher than $1. This allows a Vault owner to issue Dai that can be used to purchase assets with an additional variable amount of purchasing power. Inversely, when Dai is trading below a dollar, Vault owners are incentivized to purchase Dai and pay down their Dai balances at a discount.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`How can I generate Dai?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Dai generation only happens through the use of `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"vault.md\"\n      }}>{`Maker Vaults`}</a>{`.
