On the other hand, if the price of ETH was reported to be artificially high, say $1,000,000.00, then any ETH Vault owner would be able to issue an excessive amount of Dai since the system thinks there is more Collateral value than there actually is.

Pseudonymous Feeds also have the benefit of making it harder to coordinate an Oracle attack since the Feeds don’t know who the others are. Organizations running Feeds, however, are different. Organizations are much more resilient against coercion, have the resources to combat malicious actors, and have their reputations at stake. This makes them much better equipped to be Feeds with public identities.
