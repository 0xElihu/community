This means that MKR acts as a Collateral of last resort to absorb losses beyond the expected losses from Collateral locked in Vaults. `}</p>\n    <p>{`If MKR is being used as a Collateral of first resort i.e. as a collateral type locked in Vaults, then it would take away from its effectiveness as a Collateral of last resort.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A negative feedback loop would occur in a scenario when a falling MKR price would trigger the liquidation of MKR-collateralized Vaults, further causing downward pressure on MKR price. `}</p>\n    <p>{`While downward price pressure in a liquidation is a risk applicable to any collateral type, the systemic risk with MKR is potentially greater because falling MKR price directly reduces the amount of value available to recapitalize all collateral types across the Maker Protocol. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Downward spirals in MKR price also make the Maker Protocol more vulnerable to governance attacks, wherein the cost of buying enough MKR to vote for changes favorable to an attacker becomes more affordable. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Furthermore, if both systemic bad debt and MKR-Vault liquidations were to happen at the same time, then they would become self-reinforcing, increasing the risk of a severe collapse of the value of MKR and reducing its effectiveness as a Collateral of last resort.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Finally, there is the argument about circular financing. It stands to reason that the value of MKR may be correlated to the total amount of Dai in circulation.
