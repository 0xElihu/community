# Vault Risk

<Callout icon="warning">

Owning a Vault is inherently risky.

</Callout>

This page describes the types of risk associated with owning a Vault and provides common practices for mitigating those risks. There are four major categories of risks to consider when creating a Vault: Market Risks, User Risks, Systemic Risks, and Parameter Variability Risk.

---

## Types of Risk

<Accordion>

### Market Risks

Using a Vault involves generating Dai and transferring ownership of your assets to a smart-contract that can sell your assets in the event of a market downturn. Any Vault with Generated Dai has a Liquidation Price, the price of the underlying asset at which one's Vault would be liquidated. Using a Vault for leverage introduces additional risk. The potential for reward is higher through leverage, but the potential for loss is magnified as well.

_It is a common practice among users to maintain a high Collateralization Ratio to protect from Market Risks and thereby Liquidation._

</Accordion>

<Accordion>

### User Risks

This type of risk is associated with user error. MakerDAO can NOT reverse transactions or recover funds sent to incorrect addresses or contracts.

</Accordion>

<Accordion>

### Systemic Risks

Systemic risks associated with operation of the Maker Protocol include, but are not limited to:

Malicious hacks attack against the smart-contract infrastructure.

Black Swan events involving one or more collateral assets.

Failure of centralized infrastructure. For example, failed internet connections, MetaMask bugs, etc.

</Accordion>

<Accordion>

### Parameter Variability Risk

**It's important to note that Vault owners are subject to changes in the Risk Parameters that govern the system. This equates to financial risk for the Vault owner. Below is a partial list of parameters that are subject to change:**

<List>

[Stability Fees](/learn/vaults/stability-fees/)

[Debt Ceiling](/faqs/makerdao-mcd-faqs/glossary/)

[Liquidation Penalty](/learn/vaults/liquidation/)

### Stability Fees

The Stability Fee is a variable-rate fee continuously added to a Vault owner’s generated Dai balance.

Stability Fees are a Risk Parameter designed to address the inherent risk in generating Dai against collateral in Maker Vaults.

A portion of the Stability Fee is diverted toward sustaining the operation of the Maker Protocol, which includes the DSR, Risk Teams, and other costs associated with maintaining the protocol.

Technical documentation on Stability Fees can be found in the [Jug - Detailed Documentation](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/rates-module/jug-detailed-documentation) subsection of the [Documentation Portal](https://docs.makerdao.com/).

## Stability Fee Rates

<Indent pad={2}>


The Stability Fee for each Vault type changes as a result of the decisions of MKR token holders who govern the protocol.

These decisions are based on the recommendation of Risk Teams who perform risk assessments on Collateral used in the system.

The Risk Teams may update their proposed Stability Fee when something fundamental changes about the underlying asset or the system as a whole.

</Indent>


## Where Stability Fees Go

<Indent pad={2}>


Stability Fees are collected inside the Maker Protocol’s [internal balance sheet](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/core-module/vat-detailed-documentation).

Once the maximum level of surplus is reached, the system automatically sends Dai to a [Surplus Auction](https://docs.makerdao.com/auctions/the-auctions-of-the-maker-protocol#surplus-auction). During this auction, Keepers bid in MKR for DAI. Dai is released to the winning bidder while the MKR paid by the winner gets burned.

</Indent>


## Calculating Stability Fees

<Indent pad={2}>


The Stability Fee is continuously compounding interest at a growth rate of x% per second.

Technical documentation about how Rates work in the Maker Protocol can be found in the [Rates Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/rates-module) section of our Documentation Portal

#### Example

If the Stability Fee is set to 2%, it will accumulate at 1.0000000006279371924910298109948‬% per second. At the end of year one, the user will owe exactly 2% on the principal.

Assuming the user put in 100 Dai, at the end of year one they would have 102.00. At the end of year two, they would have 104.04.

## Stability Fees During Emergency Shutdown

<Indent pad={2}>


During Emergency Shutdown, Vault owners indirectly pay Stability Fees by not being able to withdraw more collateral than the excess in their Vault.

## Mitigating Risk

**Common practices for mitigating the risks associated with owning a Vault include:**

<Box>

Using price alerts and/or notifications to monitor Vaults

Increasing the collateralization ratio of a Vault

Maintaining enough liquidity outside of your Vault to pay back Dai generated by the Vault or add to its deposited collateral
