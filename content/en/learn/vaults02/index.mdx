## What are Maker Vaults?

The Maker Vault is a core component of the Maker Protocol, which facilitates the generation of Dai against collateral. All Dai in circulation are created by Vaults.

Users create Dai by generating it against their collateral and destroy Dai when repaying their balance. This process happens on-chain, which enables full auditability of circulating Dai and the collateral backing it.

Vaults are not free to use and come with inherent risks. Generating Dai requires the payment of [Stability Fees](/learn/vaults/stability-fees/) (SF). The SF is a variable rate and is subject to change based on the decisions of MKR Token holders through [voting](/learn/governance/how-voting-works/). To reclaim collateral, users must repay the previously generated Dai and the accumulated SF.

Vaults are required to be overcollateralized and have a [Liquidation Ratio](/learn/vaults/liquidation#liquidation-ratio) that Vault owners need to uphold to avoid the [Liquidation](/learn/vaults/liquidation/) of their Vaults. What a Vault is liquidated, a [Liquidation Penalty](/learn/vaults/liquidation#liquidation-penalty) is applied, and collateral is sold to repay the Vault's outstanding Dai balance. Additionally, a Debt Ceiling is imposed globally on the Maker Protocol, as well as individually on each Vault type.

## Why use Maker Vaults?

Vaults let users access the underlying value of their assets while avoiding the need to sell them.

Popular examples of how users are utilizing Vaults are listed below:

**Leverage**

Speculators can “leverage” collateral to increase their exposure to an asset by investing Dai generated from their Vault. Users should use caution as leveraging assets magnifies the potential for losses in addition to gains.

**Draw Liquidity from Your Assets**

People can use vaults at any time to generate Dai and make investments or purchases.

**Flexible Repayment Schedule**

There are no repayment schedules, minimum payments, or credit requirements. Users can repay at their own pace as long as their vault is collateralized.
