## Why use Maker Vaults?

A vault let’s you put your crypto to work. Instead of selling your long-term crypto holdings when you need cash, you can borrow Dai against them. Dai is a stable coin, that means you can use it for almost anything you can use dollars for.

TIP: Don’t forget to put your extra Dai to work by earning interest on Oasis Save. With MakerDAO there is always something you can do with your crypto.

Tell them how they can earn interest with Save and pay down high interest traditional finance debt with Borrow.

Camera pans to Oprah. You get a lambo, and you get a lambo. Cut to guy in a beater. Did you know you can leverage your Ethereum and then use the Dai to buy anything you want. Even a new car? Banks can’t tell you you don’t have good credit as long as you have the crypto to borrow against.

Jokes aside, There is something here. 
Simple: MakerDAO means secured loans for anything, for anyone, at any time.
