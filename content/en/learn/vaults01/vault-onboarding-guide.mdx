# Vault Onboarding Guide

## The Basics

<Indent pad={2}>

The Maker Protocol offers access to decentralized, non-custodial, and permissionless leverage through Maker Vaults. Users can generate the Dai stablecoin by locking assets as collateral in a Vault using Oasis Borrow. It is important for individuals to be mindful of the risks associated with Vault usage, including those indicated in the applicable Terms of Service. This brief guide outlines the basics of getting started with Vaults on Oasis Borrow. While it presents the main features of Oasis Borrow, it only serves as an overall and general introduction.

### What is a Vault?

<Indent pad={3}>

The Maker Vault is a core component of the Maker Protocol, which facilitates the generation of Dai against locked up collateral. All Dai in circulation are created by Vaults.

Vault usage collectively alters the total supply of Dai. Users create Dai by generating it against their collateral and in-turn destroy Dai when repaying their generated Dai balance. This process happens on-chain, which enables full auditability of circulating Dai and the collateral backing it.

Vaults are not free to use and come with inherent risks. Generating Dai requires the payment of [Stability Fees](/learn/vaults/stability-fees/) (SF). The SF is a variable rate and is subject to change based on the decisions of MKR Token holders through [voting](/learn/governance/how-voting-works/). To reclaim collateral, users must repay the previously generated Dai and the accumulated SF.

Vaults are required to be overcollateralized and have a [Liquidation Ratio](/learn/vaults/liquidation#liquidation-ratio) that Vault owners need to uphold to avoid the [Liquidation](/learn/vaults/liquidation/) of their Vaults. What a Vault is liquidated, a [Liquidation Penalty](/learn/vaults/liquidation#liquidation-penalty) is applied, and collateral is sold to repay the Vault's outstanding Dai balance. Additionally, a Debt Ceiling is imposed globally on the Maker Protocol, as well as individually on each Vault type.

## Vault Types

Vaults are categorized by the type of collateral used to generated Dai. Users create Dai by generating it against their collateral and destroy Dai when repaying their generated Dai balance.

The process of generating Dai happens entirely on-chain, which enables anyone to audit the amount of circulating Dai and the collateral backing it.

For a current list of Collateral types and Vault types, please visit [Oasis Borrow](https://oasis.app/borrow) or try one of these [other Maker Vault front-ends](https://awesome.makerdao.com/#third-party-vault-portals).

## Collateralization

Vaults are required to be overcollateralized and have a [Liquidation Ratio](/learn/vaults/liquidation/) that Vault owners need to uphold to avoid the Liquidation of their positions.

Additionally, a Debt Ceiling is imposed on the Maker Protocol as well as each Vault type. The Debt Ceiling is the maximum amount of Dai that can be generated.

The Global Debt Ceiling limits the amount of Dai that can be generated across the entire system, while Vault-specific Debt-Ceilings limit how much Dai each type of Vault can generate.

## General Information on Vaults

The sections below present some best practices, useful tips, and resources related to Maker Vaults.

### Community Observed Means to Avoid Liquidation

**Maintaining a Vault's Health is the Vault Owner's Responsibility.**

Given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, a safe Vault can become at risk very quickly depending on the Dai balance and amount of Collateral locked within. Ensuring that the collateralized assets remain safe from liquidation is entirely in the hands of each Vault owner. Some commonly observed practices to avoid liquidation can be found below:

**Monitor the Vault**

- Keep note of the Vault ID numbers that you are responsible for. This will enable you to identify your Vault without needing access to the wallet that owns it.
- Maintain adequate access to the Vaults, especially during volatile periods in the markets.
- Use [available tools and services](https://awesome.makerdao.com/#watch-your-dai) to keep an eye on a Vault’s status.
- Set up price alerts for the collateral asset(s) being used, so that you know when the Liquidation Price is being approached.

**Maintain Sideline Assets**

- Maintain access to readily available emergency funds or assets to pay back Dai or add collateral.

**Unwind the Vault**

- Unwinding is when some collateral is withdrawn from the Vault and sold for Dai, the Dai is then used to pay down the Vault's generated Dai balance. Repeat the process until the Liquidation Price is a comfortable number.
- When done manually, this technique temporarily puts the Vault in a riskier position until Dai is paid on the balance. This is because collateral is being withdrawn, which increases the Liquidation Price.
- Set a personal rule to unwinding the Vault if the collateral price falls below a certain level or takes a sharp downturn. This may act as an additional buffer.
- Some services will offer Vault unwinding for a nominal fee.

</Box>


<Box>


**Use a Vault Unwinding Service**

- There are 3rd party web3 applications that enable a Vault owner to automate the unwinding process. One example is [DefiSaver.com’s](https://defisaver.com/) Automate feature.
- Note that the Vault owner is responsible for doing their due diligence to assess whether such a service is safe to use and legitimate.
