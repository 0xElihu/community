# Why Vaults?

## Why Open a Vault?

<Indent pad={3}>

Vaults let users access the underlying value of their assets while avoiding the need to sell them.

Some popular examples of how users are utilizing Vaults are listed below:

<List>

**Leverage**

Speculators can “leverage” collateral in a decentralized manner to increase exposure to a given asset by investing Dai generated from their Vault. Users seeking leverage should proceed with caution as it magnifies the risk of loss as well as the potential for gains.

**Draw Liquidity from Your Assets**

Users looking for liquidity can turn to Vaults since Dai can serve any purpose. Some examples generate Dai off of their cryptocurrency assets to purchase automobiles, pay college tuition, or cover home renovations.

**Flexible Repayment Schedule**

Vaults offer flexible terms. There are no repayment schedules, no minimum payments, and no credit history requirements. Users can repay at their own pace as long as their Vault is properly collateralized. Read the section below on “Best Practices to Avoid Liquidation” for more in-depth information about how to maintain a healthy Vault.
