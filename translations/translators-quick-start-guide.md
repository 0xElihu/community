# Translators Quick-Start Guide

Welcome to the MakerDAO Translation Initiative! Our goal is to bring Maker’s educational content worldwide by providing material for people in their native languages. This document summarizes the guidelines for translators.

## Role and Responsibility

The translator’s role is to create the initial translation from the original English documents.

Goals and responsibilities are to:

- **Translate as directly to the new language as possible:** All languages have their nuances, so there is flexibility to change the text to be more readable in the new language. Communicate early and often. Join the #translation channel. Don’t be afraid to ask others for advice. 
- **Decide what unique terms translate to:** Refer to the [Glossary](https://community-development.makerdao.com/faqs/glossary), if the term doesn’t appear there bring the subject up in the #translation room for discussion.
- **Accurate spelling and grammar:** Minimize mistakes and typos.
- **Consistency:** Ensure terms are translated uniformly across all documents.
- **Simplicity:** Our aim is to reach a broad audience. As such, writing should be plain, simple, and accessible. Maintain contact with other translators as they work on documents. Be sure to agree on translated terms and other conventions.
- **Formatting:** Ensure that translated documents retain original formatting.
- **Adherence to the [Style Guide](https://github.com/makerdao/community/blob/master/contributing/style-guide.md):** Writing style must be consistent throughout all documents.

## Language

The blockchain space is relatively new. Various languages are slowly developing terms to match the English vocabulary. However, not all terms exist. Reach out to other community members in the #translation room to consult on the best way to translate various terminology.

There’s an [English glossary of MakerDAO terms](https://community-development.makerdao.com/faqs/glossary) which one can work from. There is a chance this glossary has been translated into your language. You should strive to translate each of these terms in a way that makes sense. Additionally, the way the terms are translated should be consistent throughout the documents.

## Best Practices

- **Use Markdown:** All documents are formatted in Markdown. They contain headers, lists, links, tables, etc.. Information on Markdown can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Alternatively, this [cheat-sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a good reference as well.
- **Maintain Original Formatting:** Refer to the [style guide](https://github.com/makerdao/community/blob/master/contributing/style-guide.md).
- **Use a Markdown Editor:** Editors like [hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io/) or [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) make working with Markdown more convenient.
- **Keep Hyperlinks as they are:** Do not translate them! The editors will handle any necessary changes to links.
- **Take notes:** of the specific things you would like editors to keep in mind.
- **Editor Tools:** Feel free to use any software that helps find translation errors and improve writing. We encourage using tools that assist workflow. Mindlessly copying from a program will disqualify you from receiving a bounty and from future assignments. Please use them as an aide and not a substitute for your work.
- **Communicate early and often**: Join the [#translation](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/translation) channel on our RocketChat. We encourage reaching out to translators and editors for guidance.

- Click “Raw”, select all, and copy to clipboard.
- Go to the markdown editor of your choice.
- Start translating!
- Forward the completed document to the project coordinator, keeping its original name(eg. `dai.md`).
